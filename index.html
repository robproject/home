            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>In Highschool I was drawn to shop classes, primarily metalshop where we could work with lathes and a cnc
                mill. My free time was spent riding mountain bikes and dirt bikes, flipping used motorcycles, learning
                about aircraft from the mechanic at IYK, and
                dreaming of ways I could build parts for those hobbies. My first technical job was as an electronics
                technician for <a href="https://www.navair.navy.mil/nawcwd/">NAWCWD</a> in my hometown Ridgecrest, CA.
                Four years of this had me developing an interest in how electronics worked internally, and the financial
                aspect provided a seed for an entreprenurial venture. I aquired a heavily used SMT line in March 2019
                with the intent of fixing and reselling, or starting a contract manufacturing service. I pursued the
                latter. It proved to be a monumental learning experience but ultimately needed more attention than I was
                able to provide, and was dissolved during the summer of 2023. Toward the end of the venture I had
                discovered the potential of having data housed in something like a custom Django or Flask webapp
                (instead of myriad Excel workbooks), and
                stumbled upon ERPNext. I was able to land an internship with <a
                    href="https://agritheory.com">Agritheory</a> which proved to be an invaluable experience for
                learning about the platform while honing technical skills.
                I recieved a BS in electrical engineering from <a
                    href="https://www.csulb.edu/college-of-engineering">CSULB</a> AVEP in 2023 while self-studying
                computer science.
                During internships and summers I implemented features in ERPNext apps for Agritheory and <a
                    href="https://netprofitxl.ca">NetProfit XL</a>, automated processes in Microsoft 365 and Python for
                AFRL at Edwards AFB, and built an
                uncertainty propagation Flask app for Senior design.
                My career has begun by contininuing to implement features in (primarily open-source) enterprise software
                systems throughout the
                technology stack.
